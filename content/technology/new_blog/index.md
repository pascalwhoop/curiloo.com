I decided to start a new website and blog based on hugo and a template called [hextra](https://github.com/imfing/hextra). 

The idea is the following:

- pascalbrokmeier.de: Will be my digital business card. Mostly linking to other pages but with minimal information.
- curiloo.com: Hosted by myself, contains my blog and other content. Kept mostly personal-brand free, focuses on content.
