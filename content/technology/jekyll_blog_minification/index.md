excerpt: Moving away from a clean and technical but unoptimized jekyll blog to a CDN backed, more efficient blog with dynamic image sizing and more.

**Where I was:**

-   Jekyll Blog hosted on Github Pages
-   No HTTPS
-   about 1.8MB page load
-   PageSpeed Ranking of 61/100

**Where I am now:**

-   Jekyll Blog hosted with Firebase Hosting
-   HTTPS
-   X.X MB load size on initial load
-   X.X MB load size on subsequent load using caching
-   PageSpeed Ranking of XX XXX
-   Dynamicially sized images using XXXX
-   search engine ranking improvements

## Tools required

-   The [Jekyll-Cloudinary plugin](https://nhoizey.github.io/jekyll-cloudinary/#live-example) is my first step. My images are huge! I had some automated size reduction going with imagemagick but this is by far better suited to do the job
    -   An Atom custom snippet for the required liquid tag
-   Switching to Firebase for hosting. Reasons: Caching and SSL


## Where we start
I assume you have `jekyll` installed as well as `ruby-bundle` and know how to work with git(hub). If you don't then this post is most likely not for you and you should first figure out how to set up a blog using jekyll.

## Get rid of those Megapixels

**Install the jekyll plugin: [jekyll-cloudinary](https://nhoizey.github.io/jekyll-cloudinary/#installation) and of course you need to [create a cloudinary accounting](https://cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/flurhi5jzgzzan33ou6f)**

Now, my `_config.yml` looks as such

```
plugins_dir:
  - jekyll-feed
  - jekyll-sitemap
  - jekyll-seo-tag
  - jekyll-cloudinary #used for improving page load speeds with images

cloudinary:
    cloud_name:pascal-brokmeier
    presets:
    default:
      min_width: 320
      max_width: 1600
      fallback_max_width: 800
      steps: 5
      sizes: "(min-width: 50rem) 50rem, 90vw"
    banner:
      min_width: 320
      max_width: 1900
      fallback_max_width: 1600
      steps: 4
      sizes: "50vw 80vw 100vw"
```

There are several nice ways to get sexy image positioning going but I refer you to the manual of the plugin to find out more about this.

Now I used the new liquid tag for my main homepage (which sadly is riddled with images, but that is what I chose). Here are the results

To quickly add the snippet with Atom, I build a custom snippet that you can add to your snippets.cson

```cson
'.text.html.basic, .source.gfm':
  'cloudinary':
    'prefix': 'climg'
    'body': '\{\% cloudinary ${1:default} images/posts/$2/$3 alt="$4" \%\}'
```
Hint: Remove the backticks, there is only so much possible with escaping characters with 3 different systems using each other. Otherwise my jekyll pipeline breaks.
## Move to Firebase
[Based on this post](https://chris.banes.me/2017/06/02/jekyll-firebase/) the steps are quiet simple. So I'll just summarize them in a quick checklist

- Install firebase cli with `npm install -g firebase-cli`
- login
- `firebase init`
- Add `circle.yml` file as described in post
- Generate firebase-cli Key and add to circle-ci.com configuration (not in the file, in their online interface)

> **In between benchmark with Google PageSpeed Tools: 86/100** Not bad.

## Minification and further speed improvements

## Get HTTPS

This one almost comes out of the box with Firebase. You just need to verify your DNS ownership of the custom domain and Google gets you a letsencrypt HTTPS certificate. Nice.

## Get Caching of ressources

A quick DuckDuckGo-Stackoverflow-Copy-Paste: Take the snippet below and add it to your `firebase.json`

```json
"headers": [ {
  "source" : "**/*.@(eot|otf|ttf|ttc|woff|font.css)",
  "headers" : [ {
    "key" : "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
    "value" : "*"
  } ]
}, {
  "source" : "**/*.@(js|css)",
  "headers" : [ {
    "key" : "Cache-Control",
    "value" : "max-age=604800"
  } ]
}, {
  "source" : "**/*.@(jpg|jpeg|gif|png)",
  "headers" : [ {
    "key" : "Cache-Control",
    "value" : "max-age=604800"
  } ]
}, {
  "source" : "404.html",
  "headers" : [ {
    "key" : "Cache-Control",
    "value" : "max-age=300"
  } ]
} ]
```

Performance Checkup:

|  |  |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Before without Cache | 1.1Mb |
| Now without Cache | 529Kb |
| Now with Cache | 3.5 Kb|

The last result just includes the index.html. Everything else is cached (CSS, JS, img). Not bad. Let's keep going.

## Do something for my page's SEO
The improvements in page performance should already have led to quiet a bit of SEO improvements for the future. Google punished bad performance so improving the speed will also help with SEO. But there is more we can do.
